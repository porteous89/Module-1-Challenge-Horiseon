# Module-1-Challenge-Horiseon

## Description

This is a Feature Request challenge in which I have been given a starter code that I have modified and refactored.
The Challenge contains a User Story and an Acceptance Criteria to define the parameters I had to follow to complete it.
By completing this challenge I have ensured the website functions, has not changed in appearance, corrected errors in the HTML and CSS, used semantic elements to make the code clearer and easier to read/maintain, as well as refactoring the code by making it leaner and consolidated.

Given this is my first bigger project, I think it's helped firm up a lot of the information I had learened but wasn't completely comfortable using until now. It has greatly improved my knowledge of CSS as it took quite some time to go through each change ensuring it wasn't having a knock on affect elsewhere in the code.

Here is the criteria for the project:

### User Story
* AS A marketing agency
* I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
* SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria 
* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
